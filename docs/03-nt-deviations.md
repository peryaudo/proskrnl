# 03 — Deviations from Real NT

This document is the reference for **what we keep, what we drop, and what we fake**,
relative to a real Windows NT kernel. The organizing principle:

> **Keep the explicit entities user mode can see. Drop the explicit entities only drivers
> can see. Fake the rest with the correct shape.**

NT's defining habit is to turn Unix's *implicit conventions* into *explicit entities*.
That is a genuine design virtue — but an explicit entity leaks across the ABI and becomes
a contract that can no longer be redesigned. Our deviations are chosen so that the
contracts we inherit are exactly the ones observable (and testable) from an `.exe`.

## Kept exactly (the boundary)

| Entity | Why it cannot change |
|---|---|
| `Nt*` syscall semantics (the Wine-used subset) | Wine's PE DLLs depend on exact behaviour |
| `PEB`, `TEB`, `RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS` | read field-by-field by Wine DLLs; byte-exact |
| `KUSER_SHARED_DATA` @ 0x7FFE0000 | read directly for time/version |
| Handles + inheritance + duplication | the universal reference mechanism |
| Dispatcher objects + `NtWaitForMultipleObjects` (wait-all/any, alertable) | NT's best invention; Wine relies on it |
| APC delivery (kernel + user), alertable-wait semantics | I/O completion depends on it |
| Section objects (anonymous / file / image, guard pages) | process startup *is* image sections |
| NT file semantics (share modes, case rules, delete-on-close, byte-range locks, info classes) | the part Wine can't fully reproduce on Unix; our reason to exist |
| Async I/O completion protocol (IOSB timing, APC/event/port) | observable and depended-upon |
| User-mode return protocol (`KiUserExceptionDispatcher`, `KiUserApcDispatcher`) | SEH breaks without it |
| Object namespace (`\Device`, `\??`, symlinks) | `NtCreateFile("\Device\...")` must resolve |

## Dropped entirely (driver-only, unobservable)

| Dropped | What it was | Replaced by |
|---|---|---|
| **IRQL** | a number unifying interrupt-mask + preempt-disable + "no sleep in interrupt context", exported as a contract to drivers | ordinary interrupt disable + one lock; no external contract |
| **DPC** | deferred bottom-half, contractual for drivers | internal top/bottom-half, our choice |
| **IRP + IO_STACK_LOCATION** | I/O request as a heap object passed down a driver stack | a VFS-style completion record; no stack, no layering |
| **MDL** | physical-page list for a virtual buffer | direct handling in our async path |
| **WDM / PnP / power** | the driver authoring model + device enumeration state machines | drivers are statically linked in-tree modules |
| **HAL as a swappable module** | platform-difference abstraction | absorbed into `arch/x86_64/`; single platform |
| **Paged vs. NonPaged pool split** | two heaps because paged memory can fault | one pool (nothing is paged out) |
| **Cc as a separate component** | file cache, re-entrant with Mm and FS (the "triangle") | unified page cache inside Mm |
| **Pageout / working set / balance-set** | eviction machinery | nothing is evicted; commit-failure → out-of-memory |
| **ALPC** | kernel-mediated fast IPC | not needed for CUI; GUI uses shared-section transport |
| **SSDT as a patchable table** | the syscall table (historically hooked by AV/rootkits) | a plain function table; nothing to hook |

**Why dropping IRQL matters most:** IRQL is the load-bearing reason HAL exists, and the
reason ReactOS still cannot ship SMP after 30 years — its scheduler internals could not be
redesigned because IRQL/spinlock semantics were promised to third-party drivers. With no
third-party drivers, we owe that contract to no one, and SMP becomes ordinary future work.

## Faked (correct shape, hollow inside)

| Faked | Shape preserved | Inside |
|---|---|---|
| **Se (security)** | token object; `SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR` accepted by every relevant `Nt*`; `NtQueryInformationToken` info classes | "always allow"; a fixed admin token |
| **Cm hive format** | `NtCreateKey`/value semantics | our own on-disk format; no MS hive binary compat |
| **EPROCESS/ETHREAD** | exist as internal structs | layout entirely ours; nobody reads it (no drivers) |
| **DPC/IRQL surface** | absent, not stubbed | callers don't exist (no drivers) |

## Deliberate simplifications under the "stupidly correct" mandate (T4)

These are deviations from NT's *implementation*, never from its *observable semantics*:

- **No COW initially** — private/image mappings copy fully on map. Costs RAM; unobservable.
- **No eviction, immediate writeback** — makes mapped-view/`ReadFile` consistency trivial.
- **One dispatcher lock, uniprocessor** — turns every race into a plain state machine.
- **No kernel preemption** — context switches only at explicit waits and user-mode return.

Every one of these is unobservable from user mode, so none is a contract. See
`docs/09-constitution.md`, which makes these *rules*, not options.

## GUI-era additions that are NOT in NT (tracked as HACKs)

These are the only places we add something NT lacks. Each lives strictly at the boundary's
*outside* (a new device or a new process), never inside the existing `Nt*` or Wine PE code,
and each is logged in `docs/10-hacks-ledger.md`:

- **`\Device\Fb0`** (HACK-001) — map the framebuffer to user mode; NT would own this via a
  display driver behind win32k.
- **`\Device\Input0`** (HACK-002) — raw input stream to user mode; NT routes this through
  win32k/csrss.
- **wineserver-lite as a desktop server** — a user-mode server holding desktop state. Not
  a hack against NT so much as a return to NT 3.1's actual architecture (see `docs/07`).

## WOW64 (not a deviation)

Running 32-bit apps via WOW64 is **NT's real mechanism**, so it adds nothing to the hacks
ledger. Kernel cost is a few hundred lines (GDT compat descriptors, an
`IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386` branch in process creation, low-4GB address-space restriction,
compat-mode exception delivery, `ProcessWow64Information`). No `Nt*` semantics change. The
32→64 transition ("Heaven's Gate") is entirely user-mode; the kernel never sees a 32-bit
syscall. See `docs/02` §WOW64.
